<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drivers are pieces of software that enable Windows to communicate with the devices you attach to your computer, and Windows 10 has a number of them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, Windows recognizes and embraces the new component, and everything works as anticipated. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other times, before completing the task, Windows will connect to the Internet and retrieve some automatic instructions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, every now and then, you're going to plug in something that Windows doesn't recognize or remember.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Maybe something doesn't work properly on your PC, and you get some odd messages about the need for a new driver.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have the luxury of upgrading all of the drivers at once or manually choosing a few. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
